Cystoscopy  2.  Right retrograde pyelogram  3.  Right ureteral stent placement, 6 Fr x 24 cm  4.  Fluoroscopy time < 1 hour     Attending surgeon  Eric J Springer, MD     Anesthesia  MAC     Complications  None     Findings  Cystoscopy revealed no tumors, stones or other mucosal abnormalities.   Retrograde pyelogram revealed a right dilated system with filling defect in the right ureter consistent with an obstructing ureteral stone.     Indications  18 y.o. female with obstructing right ureteral stone and pyelonephritis agreed to undergo the above named procedure after discussion of the alternatives, risks and benefits.  Informed consent was obtained.       Procedure  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed dorsal lithotomy on the operating table.  Pre-operative antibiotics were administered prior to arrival to the operating room. Bilateral lower extremity SCDs were placed.  After induction of anesthesia the patient was positioned in dorsal lithotomy, prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A time-out was performed.       A 22 French rigid cystoscope was passed carefully via urethra into the bladder.  Complete cystoscopy was performed. This demonstrated no masses, bladder stones, or areas of erythema. Ureteral orifices were identified in normal position with clear efflux of urine from the left and no efflux from the right. A sensor wire was passed into the right ureter up to the kidney under fluoroscopic guidance. A 5-French open-ended catheter was passed over the wire.  A retrograde pyelogram was performed by slowly injecting 5 mL of Omnipaque contrast via the 5 French catheter with moderate hydronephrosis proximal to the expected location of the ureteral stone. A sensor wire was then placed into the upper pole of the right kidney and a 6 \nFrench x 24 cm ureteral stent was placed in retrograde fashion under fluoroscopic guidance with good coil confirmed to be in the upper pole of the kidney on fluoroscopy and in the bladder under direct vision. The cystoscope was reinserted and the bladder was drained. The patient tolerated the procedure well.     Recommend observation as inpatient until afebrile x24 hours. Will need culture specific antibiotics. Will need confirmation of clearance of UTI prior to definitive surgical management for her ureteral stone which will be done as an outpatient."
